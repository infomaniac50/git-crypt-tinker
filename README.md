## Git Crypt Tinker ##

Just me playing around with git-crypt. git-crypt seems to be a good way to store private information in a public repository.

See https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/ for more info about git-crypt.

The key to decrypt the secret file is keys/repo.key. A real repo would never store this key. However this repo is just for fun and learning.
